# National Action Plan — working notes for Claude

A clickable prototype of BZE's National Action Plan: the regional assessment
criteria, the methodology behind each indicator, and per-region scores.

**Read `review/comments.json` before starting design work.** That file is how the
team hands you work. See *The review loop* below.

## What this repo is

Plain static HTML/CSS/JS. No framework, no bundler, no build step. Pages are
hand-written HTML that pull shared data from top-level JS files and render it
client-side:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Overview — national coverage, then every region as a card |
| `map.html` | Clickable map; pins are rendered from `regions.js` |
| `city.html` | A region: theme averages, then indicators in an accordion |
| `CSC.html` | Criteria library — the five-theme wall. Structure and methodology only; no scores |
| `criterion.html` | One indicator, for one region — four tabs: Evidence, Grading scale, How it's assessed, Previous rounds. Where a row on `city.html` goes |
| `learn.html`, `assess*.html`, `previous.html` | Older indicator detail pages |
| `contributors.html`, `editor.html` | Contributor list; scoring editor |
| `styles.css` | The whole design system — single stylesheet, tokens at the top |
| `nap.js` | The site shell (header, breadcrumbs) and the shared helpers |
| `indicator-drawer.js` | **Unused.** The side panel that used to open when an indicator was clicked, replaced by `criterion.html` in August 2026. No page loads it; safe to delete |
| `indicator-icons.js` | One line glyph per assessed indicator, plus the id → glyph map. `indicatorIcon(id)` returns the badge, or `""` for an indicator with no glyph |
| `regions.js` | The 16 regions — key, display name, state, map position |
| `data.js` | Criteria structure (pillars → groups → items) |
| `scores.js` | Per-region scores, by round |
| `learn-data.js`, `evidence-*.js` | Methodology and evidence content (large) |
| `references-*.js` | One list of sources per indicator, per assessed region. Pairs with the citation markers in the evidence text — see *Citations and references* |

The design came from `scratch/nap-concept-a-report.html` and was folded into
`styles.css` in August 2026. That concept file is the reference for how the
system is meant to look.

`CSC.html` was rebuilt in August 2026 from
`scratch/csc-report-columns.html`: the criteria now read as five theme
columns laid out the way the framework is drawn in the reports, rather than
as an accordion. Its CSS is section 18 of `styles.css`; the accordion in
section 7 stays because `city.html` still uses it. Every indicator row
carries `.isDoc` or `.noDoc`, from `NAP.hasMethod(id)` — a truthy entry in
`learn-data.js` — so the page shows which methodologies are published. The
page carries no scores at all: it is the framework and the methodology behind
it, and scores are reported per region on `city.html` and on the indicator
page. It loads only `data.js`, `learn-data.js`, `indicator-icons.js` and
`nap.js` — no `scores.js`, no `regions.js`.

### House rules

1. **Never add a build step.** No npm dependencies for anything the site needs,
   no framework, no transpiling. `main` is published live by GitHub Pages,
   which serves the committed files as-is — `.nojekyll` at the repo root turns
   Jekyll off and must stay there.
2. **`styles.css` is the design system.** Change the variables and shared
   classes there rather than piling up inline styles or per-page `<style>`
   blocks. Exception: files in `scratch/` may do whatever they like.
3. **Most markup is generated at runtime.** A visual change often lives in a
   template string inside `data.js`, `learn.html` or `CSC.html`, not in static
   HTML. Grep for the class name before assuming.
4. **`review/` and `package.json` are dev-only.** They are not part of the
   deployed site. Never add a `<script src="review/overlay.js">` to a page — the
   dev server injects it into HTML responses at request time, which is what
   keeps it out of production.
5. **The header is rendered, not copied.** There is no templating, so
   `nap.js` builds the persistent header and breadcrumbs at run time. A page
   opts in with `<div id="napCrumbs"></div>` in the markup and a
   `NAP.shell({ page, crumbs })` call once it knows what it is showing.
   Don't paste a copy of the header into a page.
6. **Score vocabulary lives in `nap.js`.** `NAP.WORDS` maps 1–5 to the band
   names. Individual indicators also have their own grading scale — the
   structured one in `learn-data.js` (`scoringDescriptions`) and the
   signed-off one inside each evidence entry. Don't hard-code band names in
   a page.
7. **The score ramp is switchable.** The default is the BZE briefing-sheet
   palette, with 1 and 2 swapped so the worst score is the loudest. Two
   alternates are defined in the "Score marks and the colour ramp" section
   and are selected from the `<html>` tag:
   `data-ramp="sequential"` (one-hue blue sweep) or `data-ramp="traffic"`
   (red / amber / green). Each score carries an `--sN-ink` alongside its
   `--sN`, so a mark never has to guess which fills are light — change a
   colour and its ink travels with it.
8. Australian English in all copy (organise, prioritise, colour).

## Citations and references

The reports cite their sources — the Hunter and Gladstone reports with numbered
endnotes, the Port Hedland report with author-date in the prose and a list per
indicator. Those citations were carried into the site for Hunter Valley and
Gladstone in August 2026, and for Port Hedland in September 2026, in two
halves:

- **In the evidence text** — a marker per citation, written as
  `<sup class="refMark">1,2</sup>` at the point the report put it. Nothing
  else in the evidence prose changed: strip the markers and the file is
  byte-for-byte what was signed off.
- **In `references-<region>.js`** — `window.CITY_REFERENCES`, keyed by
  indicator id, one list per indicator. Entries are numbered from 1 within
  each indicator, in the order a reader meets them, so a marker's number is
  a position in that indicator's list and nothing more. `report` on each
  entry keeps the number the printed report used, for tracing an entry back
  to the PDF; it is data only and is never shown. For Port Hedland, `report`
  is the entry's position in that indicator's own printed list, since the
  report has no single numbered sequence.

`criterion.html` renders the list under the assessment on the Evidence tab
and turns each marker into a jump link. It does not use the URL hash for
that — the tab strip owns the hash. `previous.html` renders the same list
under the latest round only; an older round keeps its markers unresolved
rather than borrowing a newer list. A region with no `references-` file
draws exactly as before.

Kwinana has no reference file yet, so its pages probe for one and get a 404 in
the console — the same optional-file pattern as the region photo slot, and not
a fault to chase. Port Hedland has a file, but it covers 19 of its 24
indicators; the five federal-policy indicators whose evidence text is still
Kwinana's are left out deliberately, and their pages simply render no
References block.

When a new region's report is brought in, both halves have to move together.
A marker whose number has no entry is left as plain text rather than linked,
so a half-finished import degrades quietly rather than rendering a dead link.

One thing to watch: `editor.html` writes evidence paragraphs back through
Quill. An entry edited there could lose its markers, and nothing checks for
that yet.

## The review loop

The team reviews visually in the browser and hands you structured comments.

```
npm run dev        → http://localhost:5173   (zero dependencies, Node 18+)
```

They press `r`, click any element, and type what should change. Each comment is
appended to `review/comments.json`.

**When asked to action comments:**

1. Read `review/comments.json`.
2. Work only on `status: "open"` comments. Group them by `page`, then by the
   file that actually owns the markup.
3. Use `target.selector` plus `target.text` and `target.html` to find the source.
   Remember rule 3 above — the selector describes the *rendered* DOM.
4. `target.styleHints` records the computed styles at review time (font-size,
   colour, padding, radius…), which tells you what the reviewer was reacting to.
5. Make the changes. Prefer editing `styles.css` variables and shared classes
   over one-off overrides.
6. Set each handled comment's `status` to `"done"` in `review/comments.json`
   (leave everything else in the entry untouched). Open browser tabs pick the
   change up automatically. Don't clear or archive the file — the **Clear**
   button in the overlay is the reviewer's call.
7. Summarise what changed per comment number, and flag anything you chose not to
   do and why.

Don't clear or archive `comments.json` — the **Clear** button in the overlay is
the reviewer's call, and it's how they mark a round finished.

### Publishing

`main` is live at <https://www.nationalactionplan.org.au>, published by
Cloudflare Pages, which rebuilds on every push. Anything merged to `main` is on
the site about a minute later. For anything structural, work on a branch: every
branch gets its own preview URL and `main` stays untouched until you merge.

The site is **not** the repository. `deploy/build.mjs` assembles it into
`dist/`, leaving the working notes, `review/`, `scratch/`, the source documents
and the older unlinked pages behind. That script is not a build step for the
site: nothing is bundled or rewritten, and the served pages are byte-for-byte
the files here. Its list is an exclusion list, so a new page or evidence file
publishes automatically; edit it only to keep something new OFF the site.

A shared password sits in front of the whole site, from
`functions/_middleware.js`. That directory must stay at the repository root:
Cloudflare does not look for it inside `dist/`. The password lives in the
`SITE_PASSWORD` environment variable in Cloudflare and is never committed.

The repo is public, so treat everything committed as published, whether or not
the deploy filter serves it. The password gates the website, not the source.

Full detail, including the Cloudflare settings and what to do if it needs
setting up again, is in `hosting-cloudflare.md` in the project.

### Comment shape

```json
{
  "id": "cmszsn3x41",
  "seq": 1,
  "createdAt": "2026-08-19T07:52:19.096Z",
  "status": "open",
  "reviewer": "Tejesh",
  "page": "index.html",
  "category": "type",
  "priority": "high",
  "comment": "Make these nav pills smaller — 32px is too big.",
  "target": {
    "selector": "a.homeNavCard:nth-of-type(1)",
    "tag": "a",
    "classes": "homeNavCard",
    "text": "Contributors",
    "html": "<a class=\"homeNavCard\" href=\"contributors.html\">Contributors</a>",
    "ancestors": "div.container › div.homeNav",
    "rect": { "x": 60, "y": 355, "w": 375, "h": 122 },
    "styleHints": { "font-size": "32px", "padding": "22px 20px", "…": "…" }
  }
}
```

`id` is the stable key. `seq` is just the display number.

`page` values starting `scratch/` are comments on a throwaway concept, not the
real site — fix them in the concept file, not in the deployed pages.

## The scratchpad

`scratch/` holds throwaway design concepts, browsable at `/scratch/` with a
side-by-side compare view. Nothing on the real site links to it.

Use it whenever a request is exploratory — *"try a different home page"*,
*"what would this look like with more whitespace"*. Build the idea as a new file
in `scratch/` rather than editing `index.html`, so the deployed pages stay
stable until a concept is approved.

- Name files by intent: `home-editorial.html`, `csc-two-column.html`.
- Add the metadata comments so the gallery can describe them:
  `<!-- concept: … -->` and `<!-- replaces: index.html -->`.
- Link `../styles.css` so concepts inherit the design system, then override in a
  page-level `<style>` block. A concept exploring a different look may ignore it.
- Offer two or three genuinely different directions rather than one.
- Only port a concept into the real pages when asked. Porting means folding the
  concept's CSS into `styles.css` properly — not copying a `<style>` block
  across.

## Comments and git

`review/comments.json` is committed, so two reviewers can end up with duplicate
`seq` numbers or a duplicated entry after a merge. Keep both sides when
resolving a conflict in that file, then run:

```
npm run review:normalise
```

which dedupes by `id` and renumbers `seq` chronologically.

Archived batches live in `review/archive/` and are also committed — they're the
record of what each design round asked for. Never edit or delete an archive.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Serve the site with review overlay + live reload |
| `npm start` | Same, and open a browser |
| `npm run dev -- --port 4000` | Use a specific port |
| `npm run dev:noreview` | Serve exactly what deploys — no overlay |
| `npm run review:show` | Print current comments to the terminal |
| `npm run review:normalise` | Dedupe + renumber after a git merge |

## Indicators assessed ahead of their methodology

Three indicators were scored for the first time in the August 2026 round
(Port Hedland and Kwinana) before their methodology was published: water and
wastewater, housing, and community engagement. Their pages say the
methodology is due with Version 3 of the assessment process, from
`NAP.V3_NOTE` in `nap.js` — one sentence, used by both `learn.html` (through
`NAP.noMethodCallout`) and the "How it's assessed" tab on `criterion.html`.
Change the wording there, not in either page.

The line is tied to *assessed but not documented*, so it appears and
disappears on its own: write an indicator up in `learn-data.js` and it goes
away; score a new one before its methodology lands and it appears. The 26
indicators never assessed anywhere keep the plain call for expertise
instead — nothing is promised for them.

## Evidence and the grading scale

Every signed-off entry in an `evidence-<region>.js` file starts with a
paragraph titled **Indicator grading scale**, followed by the assessment
prose. This was true of all 87 rounds across the four regions as at
August 2026.

`indicator-drawer.js` relies on that shape: it lifts the scale paragraph into
a collapsed block at the top of the drawer and renders the rest as the
evidence body. Nothing is rewritten and nothing is dropped — the paragraph is
shown verbatim, just moved into the slot it belongs in. If an entry does not
follow the shape, its first paragraph stays in the body where it was written.

Don't "fix" the duplication by editing evidence text. The scale living in
both `learn-data.js` and the evidence entries is a content question for the
team, not something to resolve in a template.
